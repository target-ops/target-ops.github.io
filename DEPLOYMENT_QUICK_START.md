## 🎯 Do This Right Now (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
```bash
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Click "Continue with GitHub"
3. Click "New Project"
4. Find "targetops-devops-showcase"
5. Click "Import"
6. Click "Deploy" (don't change anything!)
7. Wait 2 minutes...
8. DONE! ✅
```

You'll get a URL like: `https://targetops-devops-showcase.vercel.app`

**Test it! Your React site is now LIVE!** (Just not on your domain yet)

---

### Step 2: Finish Content (1-2 Weeks)

Work on migrating content using the Vercel URL for testing.

**Your Hugo site stays live at target-ops.io** - nothing changes!

---

### Step 3: Switch Domain (When Ready)

**In Vercel:**
1. Project Settings → Domains
2. Add "target-ops.io"
3. Vercel shows you DNS records

**In GoDaddy:**
1. DNS Management
2. Delete old A records (GitHub Pages IPs)
3. Add new A record: `76.76.21.21` (Vercel)
4. Update CNAME: `www` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`
5. Save

**Wait 30 minutes** → Your new React site is live at target-ops.io! 🎉

---

## 🔄 Safe Migration Timeline

### Week 1
- Deploy to Vercel → Get `xyz.vercel.app` URL
- Test everything works
- Share with team for feedback

### Week 2-3
- Finish content migration
- Test on Vercel URL
- Fix any bugs

### Week 4
- Final approval
- Switch GoDaddy DNS to Vercel

**Hugo site stays as backup!** Can rollback anytime by changing DNS.

---

## 🚨 Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong after switching:

**5-Minute Rollback:**
1. Login to GoDaddy
2. Change DNS back to:
   - A Records: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, etc.
   - CNAME: `www` → `target-ops.github.io`
3. Save
4. Wait 30 minutes
5. Hugo site is live again! ✅
