Slack provide a Web API that gives you the ability to build applications that interact with Slack in a variety of ways. This Development Kit is a module based wrapper that makes interaction with that API easier. We have a basic example here with some of the more common uses but a full list of the available methods are available <https://api.slack.com/methods|here>. More detailed examples can be found in <https://slack.dev/python-slack-sdk/web/|our guide>.
