## üéØ Strategy Overview

### 1. **Why Articles Drive Traffic**

**Google's Perspective:**

### 2. **The Compound Effect**

Publishing weekly articles creates **exponential growth**:

| 1     | 4        | 100-300             |
| 3     | 12       | 500-1,500           |
| 6     | 24       | 2,000-5,000         |
| 12    | 48       | 10,000-25,000       |

Each article compounds:
